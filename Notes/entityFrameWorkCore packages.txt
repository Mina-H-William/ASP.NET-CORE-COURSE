The SQL Server package (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer) already includes the base Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore package as a dependency

When you install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer, it automatically brings in the core EF package

You don't need to install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore separately
